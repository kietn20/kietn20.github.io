        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>The main idea of this game is to dodge anything that is flying towards your sprite.<br>The scoring system was a certain time(seconds) that the player must achieve to win the level.<br> I set the sprites flying towards the main sprite to fly in random directions and x's.<br> There are three types of difficulties: Easy, Medium, and Hard. When the flying sprites come<br> in contact with the main sprite, it will broadcast GAMEOVER, which will show a screen that says "GAMEOVER". </p>
        <br>
        <h2>Reflection</h2>
        <p>I made this game because I realized the concept of this game include all the requirements of the criteria(Ex: random block, MORE blocks, <br>ranges in difficulties, etc).  What inspired me to make this game was "World Hardest Game 1,2,3". Two successful points in the development of my game was how was I going use the MORE BLOCKS in my script and how to increase the difficulties without making it impossible to win. Two obstacles in the development process of my game would be the fault of a BROADCAST bug and how to RESET a level when you lose. I overcame the first problem by deleting the entire sprite and starting over ,and I used a varible to differ which level would be broadcast when the reset button is pressed. If I had <br>more time or resources, then I would improve on the movements/costumes of the sprites.  </p>
        <br>
        <img src="snip.PNG"> 
        <p>This algorithm contributes significantly to the game because it moves the main sprite to dodge all of the other sprites. When the level start, set the main sprite coordinates to (0,0) or the center of the screen. There is a forever script that forever states that if DOWN, UP, RIGHT, or LEFT are pressed then it would move in that direction. When it is moving, it changes costumes to make it seems like it's actually moving instead of just sliding.   </p>

        <br>
        <h2>Summary</h2>
        <p>The title of the story is pretty explanatory. A Boy is biking his way back home when he sees an opposum, half dead, dragging itself towards the side of the street to escape the waves of cars approaching. The Boy must make a decisive decision to rescue the opposum or just leave it. This decision will eventually lead him to his demise or a happy ending. </p>

        <br>
        <p>When in the development of this game, my first step was to contruct a simple, but fun story with many endings. The Boy's Sacrifice was built in chronological order and was later translated into python. Each decisive desicion or commentary was spilt into scenes. At each decision scence, I provided a very simple and comprehensive question that would change the story's path. I replay the code again and again to fix any issues after the desicion was made. One major problem I encountered was the use of randomization. For some reason, importing random harder than I expected. Furthermore, desicion made in this game was a range from (1-3). If random was 1, then one scene would play and the same for 2. However, the issue was the wrong scene would roll for random 1 and vice versa for random 2. To resolve this issue, I made conditions that the code had to run for deciding each desicion.    </p>
        <br>
        <p>Organizing each scene into a separate function is a form of procedural abstraction because the code is divided into many small codes that outputs the scene. Each scene would have the next scene connected to the next via a desicion. So after completing the defining part, only one code is needed to play the story. This allows the programming to be simple and more efficient to run.  </p>
        <br>
        <p>One story that was interesting was about aliens. The text and format in the terminal was very clean. After each desicion, the previous texts would be deleted and be replace witht he following scene's. The story was very well polished and fun.</p>
